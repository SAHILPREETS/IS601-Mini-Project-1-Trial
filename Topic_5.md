## Remote Remove:
It is used to remove the remote URL from your repository.The “git remote rm” command takes one argument:

A remote name, for example, destination

```

Example: 
git remote rm destination
# Remove remote	
$ git remote -v
```


## Remote Show:
The show subcommand in git remote  gives detailed output on the configuration of a remote. 

This output will contain a list of branches associated with the remote and also the endpoints attached for fetching and pushing.



```
Git remote show upstream
```

## Status:  
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
		
 Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.

```
git status
```

## Master Branch:
In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch.

This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.
